### to do list

* ~~limit the flags and display their amount (that increases/ decreases) next to the table.~~

* new implementation for win-check function (check if the user has won only if the flags positions on td elements equal mines positions in raw_table)

* ~~increase table's size in easy mode + make it a different rectangle size than a square~~
